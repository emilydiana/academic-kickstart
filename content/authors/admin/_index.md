I am a fourth year PhD student in Statistics at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/). I hold a B.A. in Applied Mathematics from Yale and an M.S. in Statistics from Stanford. 

Before graduate school, I worked for two years as a scientific software developer at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/), focusing on improving the performance of government finite element physics simulation codes.
